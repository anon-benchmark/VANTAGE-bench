# scripts/

Scripts in this folder fall into two groups: **participant tools** (used when running the benchmark) and **internal/dev tools** (used to manage infra or debug).

> **Looking for the higher-level workflow?** [`../skills/README.md`](../skills/README.md) has agent-driven playbooks that orchestrate these scripts together (data prep → inference → validation → packaging) end to end.

---

## Participant tools

### `package_submission.py`

Bundles per-task `*_submission.jsonl` files from an inference run into the `.tar.gz` archive required by the submission portal at <submission-portal-url>.

```bash
python scripts/package_submission.py \
  --work-dir ./outputs/<model>/<eval_id> \
  --out submission.tar.gz
```

Automatically maps each file to its canonical task name, prints pillar coverage, and warns if a pillar is incomplete. See [`docs/vantage/SUBMISSION.md`](../docs/vantage/SUBMISSION.md) for the full submission guide.

---

### `run_lmudata.py` + `RUN_LMUData.md`

The primary data-prep script. Downloads `anonymous/VANTAGE-Bench` from HuggingFace and reshapes it into the LMUData folder layout that VLMEvalKit expects.

```bash
# One-time setup: prepare all eight tasks
hf auth login
python scripts/run_lmudata.py --all --lmu-root ~/LMUData
```

See [`RUN_LMUData.md`](RUN_LMUData.md) for the full guide: prerequisites (ffmpeg, gdown), per-task flags, troubleshooting, and copy vs. symlink modes.

---

### `preflight_check.py`

Checks that the environment is ready to run inference before you start: GPU availability, disk space, ffmpeg, HF token, and network reachability. Exits non-zero on any blocking issue.

```bash
python scripts/preflight_check.py --lmu-root ~/LMUData [--json]
```

---

### `validate_submission.py`

Validates `*_submission.jsonl` files (or a built `.tar.gz`) before upload: JSONL schema, canonical id format, duplicate ids, pillar completeness, and empty/failed predictions. Written to guard against `emit_submission()` silently swallowing errors.

```bash
python scripts/validate_submission.py --work-dir ./outputs/<model>/<eval_id> --lmu-root ~/LMUData [--json]
```

---

### `run_manifest.py`

Generates `run_manifest.json` (run provenance: git commit, package versions, GPU, dataset keys, per-task counts) and `form_metadata.md` (a draft of every field on the submission portal) from a completed output directory.

```bash
python scripts/run_manifest.py --work-dir ./outputs/<model>/<eval_id> [--json]
```

---

## Internal / dev tools

These are not needed to run the benchmark. They're kept here for maintainer use.

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `auto_run.py` | Iterates all registered non-API local models and emits run commands. Upstream VLMEvalKit utility. |
| `apires_scan.py` | Scans a model output directory for prediction files and checks for API failure strings. Debugging aid. |
| `data_browser.py` | Gradio app for visually browsing dataset samples. Run with `python scripts/data_browser.py`. |
| `summarize.py` | Aggregates benchmark scores from output files. Upstream VLMEvalKit utility (references non-VANTAGE datasets). |
| `convert_macbench.py` | Format converter for MacBench data. Upstream utility. |
| `setup_gemma4_instance.sh` | One-time setup script for an internal Gemma4 eval instance. Internal infra. |
| `srun.sh` | SLURM job submission wrapper. Internal HPC use. |
| `cover.sh` | Internal coverage helper. |
| `AI2D_preproc.ipynb` | Notebook for preprocessing AI2D dataset. Upstream utility. |
| `visualize.ipynb` | Notebook for visualizing benchmark outputs. |

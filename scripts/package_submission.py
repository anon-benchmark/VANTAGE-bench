package_submission.py - Bundle per-task submission JSONL files into the
.tar.gz archive required by the VANTAGE-Bench submission portal.

Usage:
    python scripts/package_submission.py \
        --work-dir ./outputs/<model>/<eval_id> \
        --out submission.tar.gz

The script walks <work-dir>, finds every submission JSONL the harness wrote,
maps each to its canonical task filename, and creates a .tar.gz.  Only tasks
that were actually run are included.  The submission portal validates that
all tasks within each selected pillar are present.

Two file naming conventions are accepted, because run.py writes different
names depending on --mode:
    <model>_<dataset>_submission.jsonl   written by dataset.evaluate()
                                         (--mode all, --mode eval)
    <model>_<dataset>.submission.jsonl   written by the inference loop
                                         (--mode infer)

When several files match one task, the canonical split of the dataset
(e.g. VANTAGE_2DGrounding, VANTAGE_VQA_8frame) is preferred over variant or
debug splits (VANTAGE_2DGrounding_val, VANTAGE_2DGrounding_small,
VANTAGE_VQA_8frame_200); ties are broken by modification time (newest wins).
A variant split is still accepted when it is the only file for that task,
and the chosen file is always printed.

Canonical task filenames (inside the archive):
    vqa.jsonl               VANTAGE_VQA_*
    event_verification.jsonl VANTAGE_EventVerification_*
    temporal.jsonl          VANTAGE_Temporal_*
    dvc.jsonl               VANTAGE_DVC_*
    sot.jsonl               VANTAGE_SOT*
    grounding.jsonl         VANTAGE_2DGrounding*
    pointing.jsonl          VANTAGE_2DPointing*
    astro.jsonl             Astro2D*

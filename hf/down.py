"""
Dataset download helper — for most users, use run_lmudata.py instead.

    python scripts/run_lmudata.py --all --lmu-root ~/LMUData

This script is kept as a low-level alternative for downloading individual
archive files from a private/internal HuggingFace dataset repo using the
snapshot_download API. It is not needed for the public benchmark workflow.

Usage (internal / advanced only):
  1. Set HF_REPO to your dataset repo id.
  2. Set LOCAL_DIR to the target local directory.
  3. Edit TARGET_PATTERNS to match the files you want to pull.
  4. Run: python hf/down.py
